JSONField with a hacky support for quering
==========================================

WARNING: It is not advised to use in a high-loaded projects!

There is a native django.contrib.postgres.fields.JSONField for Postgres (new in Django 1.9): https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/contrib/postgres/fields/#querying-jsonfield

This module was tested on Django >=1.4, <=1.8.

Example:
    
    class Person(models.Model):
        ...
        info = JSONField(default = {})

        objects = JSONAwareManager(json_fields = ['info'])

    ...

    obj = Person.objects.create(name = "Bill")

    obj.info = {
        'sex': 'male',
        'address': {
            'city', 'Perth',
            'country', 'Canada',
            'planet', 'Earth',  
        }
    }

    obj.save()

    Person.objects.filter(info__address__country = 'Canada')

    >>> [Person: "Bill"]
